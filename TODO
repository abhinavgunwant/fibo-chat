- configure database
- create a table that contains currently logged in users
- create a system that tracks whether a user is logged in or not
- add the feature:
    - if I am A and I want to talk to B:
        - I will search the contact on the server
        - I will add B to my contact list
        - I will ask B to start communication by sending a communication request
        - once B accepts the communication request, we will begin the chat
        - no chat data is stored by the server
        - the role of the server is to provide both the clients the socket
            addresses to establish the connection between them.
        - once both the clients get the required socket addresses, they start
            their own server instances to communicate with each other, the
            socket addresses of these servers are also exchanged through server
            (the MAIN server).
